# GitHub Pages Configuration

# This file prevents the automatic GitHub Pages deployment workflow from running.

# Instead, use the manual workflow in .github/workflows/pages.yml or disable Pages entirely.

#

# To use this repository with GitHub Pages:

# 1. Go to Settings → Pages

# 2. Set Source to "GitHub Actions" (not "Deploy from a branch")

# 3. The custom workflow will handle deployment

#

# To disable GitHub Pages:

# 1. Go to Settings → Pages

# 2. Set Source to "None"
