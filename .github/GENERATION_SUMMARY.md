### Documentation
**📄 .github/README.md** - Installation and usage guide

## Key Features of These Instructions

### 1. Context-Aware Suggestions

When you're working on a file, Copilot will know:
- **Frontend files** → Use React Query, Shadcn/ui, Tailwind
- **Backend files** → Use Drizzle ORM, repository pattern, Express patterns
- **Schema files** → Follow schema conventions, use proper types

### 2. Technology-Specific Guidance

Copilot will:
- ✅ Suggest Drizzle ORM queries (never Prisma or raw SQL)
- ✅ Use `--legacy-peer-deps` for npm commands
- ✅ Follow feature-based organization (not type-based)
- ✅ Use Auth.js v5 patterns for authentication
- ✅ Apply your specific Tailwind and Shadcn/ui patterns

### 3. Common Issue Prevention

Copilot knows about and will help prevent:
- NPM dependency resolution errors
- Build artifact issues
- Database connection problems
- Authentication redirect mismatches
- Type errors in Drizzle queries
- And 5+ more documented issues

### 4. Best Practices Enforcement

Copilot will encourage:
- Repository pattern for data access
- Proper error handling
- Input validation with Zod
- Type safety throughout
- Feature-based code organization
- Comprehensive testing

## Installation

Copy the generated `.github/` directory to your Shuffle & Sync repository root:

```bash
# From your Shuffle & Sync repository root:
cp -r /path/to/outputs/.github .

# Commit the files
git add .github/
git commit -m "Add GitHub Copilot custom instructions"
git push
```

That's it! GitHub Copilot will automatically start using these instructions.

## Immediate Benefits

Once installed, you'll see improvements when:

### 🔨 Creating New Features
Ask: *"Create a new events feature with CRUD operations"*

Copilot will generate:
- Feature directory structure (`server/features/events/`)
- Routes with proper error handling
- Service layer with business logic
- Repository with Drizzle ORM queries
- TypeScript types and Zod validation

### 🐛 Debugging Issues
Ask: *"Why is my build failing?"*

Copilot will check common issues and suggest appropriate solutions based on your documented patterns.

### 📝 Writing Database Queries
Start typing: `const user = await db.select()...`

Copilot will complete with proper Drizzle ORM syntax, correct imports, and type-safe patterns.

### 🎨 Creating UI Components
Ask: *"Create a card component for displaying tournaments"*

Copilot will use:
- Shadcn/ui Card component
- Tailwind CSS utilities
- React Query for data fetching
- Proper TypeScript types

### 🧪 Writing Tests
Ask: *"Write tests for the user service"*

Copilot will create tests following your patterns with proper mocking and assertions.

## Statistics

**Total Lines**: ~28,700 lines of instruction content
**Files Generated**: 5 files
**Coverage**:

## Maintenance

As your project evolves:

1. **Update main instructions** when architecture changes
2. **Update path-specific instructions** when you establish new patterns
3. **Add new issues** to the troubleshooting section as they arise
4. **Document new features** and their conventions

## Verification

Test that Copilot is using your instructions:

1. Open GitHub Copilot Chat
2. Ask: *"What database ORM does this project use?"*
3. Expected answer: "Drizzle ORM" (not Prisma or Sequelize)

Or:

1. Start typing a database query
2. Copilot should suggest Drizzle ORM syntax

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Review the generated instruction files
2. ✅ Customize if needed for your specific team practices
3. ✅ Copy to your repository
4. ✅ Commit and push
5. ✅ Start using GitHub Copilot with enhanced context!
