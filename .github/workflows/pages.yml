# Simple workflow for deploying static content to GitHub Pages
name: Deploy Documentation to Pages

# Before this workflow can run successfully, you must:
# 1. Go to Settings → Pages
# 2. Set Source to "GitHub Actions" (not "Deploy from a branch")
#
# This workflow is disabled for automatic runs to prevent deployment failures.
# Once Pages is configured, remove the 'if: false' condition from the job below.

on:
  # Disabled automatic runs until Pages is configured
  # push:
  #   branches: ["main"]
  #   paths:
  #     - 'docs/**'
  #     - '.github/workflows/pages.yml'

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
