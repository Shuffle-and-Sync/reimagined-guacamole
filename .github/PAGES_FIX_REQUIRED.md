# ‚ö†Ô∏è ACTION REQUIRED: GitHub Pages Configuration

## Issue

GitHub Pages automatic deployment is failing with error:
```
HttpError: Validation Failed (422)
```

## Quick Fix (2 minutes)

### Option 1: Enable GitHub Actions for Pages ‚úÖ (Recommended)

1. Go to **[Repository Settings ‚Üí Pages](../../settings/pages)**
2. Under **"Build and deployment"**:
   - Change **Source** from ~~"Deploy from a branch"~~ to **"GitHub Actions"**
3. Click **Save**

**Result**: The new workflow (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`) will deploy documentation from the `docs/` folder to GitHub Pages.

### Option 2: Disable Pages üõë (If not needed)

1. Go to **[Repository Settings ‚Üí Pages](../../settings/pages)**
2. Under **"Build and deployment"**:
   - Change **Source** to **"None"**
3. Click **Save**

**Result**: Pages deployment will be completely disabled and the failing workflow will stop.

## What Changed

- ‚úÖ Created new Pages workflow: `.github/workflows/pages.yml`
- ‚úÖ Workflow deploys `docs/` directory to Pages
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive documentation: `docs/GITHUB_PAGES_DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md`
- ‚è≥ **Waiting for repository settings update**

## Why This Happened

The automatic GitHub Pages workflow (created by GitHub) fails when:
- Pages is enabled BUT
- The deployment source is set to "Deploy from a branch" instead of "GitHub Actions"

The new custom workflow fixes this by properly deploying using GitHub Actions.

## More Information

See [docs/GITHUB_PAGES_DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md](../docs/GITHUB_PAGES_DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md) for detailed explanation and troubleshooting.
