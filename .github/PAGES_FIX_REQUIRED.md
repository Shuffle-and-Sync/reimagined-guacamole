# ‚ö†Ô∏è ACTION REQUIRED: GitHub Pages Configuration

## ‚úÖ Workflow Updated - No More Automatic Failures

The GitHub Pages workflow has been updated to prevent automatic deployment failures. The workflow will only run when manually triggered until you configure Pages properly.

## Issue

GitHub Pages automatic deployment was failing with error:
```
HttpError: Validation Failed (422)
```

## Quick Fix (2 minutes)

### Option 1: Enable GitHub Actions for Pages ‚úÖ (Recommended)

1. Go to **[Repository Settings ‚Üí Pages](../../settings/pages)**
2. Under **"Build and deployment"**:
   - Change **Source** from ~~"Deploy from a branch"~~ to **"GitHub Actions"**
3. Click **Save**
4. Edit `.github/workflows/pages.yml`:
   - Remove the line: `if: github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch'`
   - Uncomment the `push:` trigger section
5. Commit and push the changes

**Result**: The workflow will automatically deploy documentation from the `docs/` folder to GitHub Pages on every push to main.

### Option 2: Disable Pages üõë (If not needed)

1. Go to **[Repository Settings ‚Üí Pages](../../settings/pages)**
2. Under **"Build and deployment"**:
   - Change **Source** to **"None"**
3. Click **Save**
4. Optionally delete `.github/workflows/pages.yml`

**Result**: Pages deployment will be completely disabled and no workflows will run.

## What Changed

- ‚úÖ Workflow no longer runs automatically on push (prevents failures)
- ‚úÖ Workflow can be triggered manually from Actions tab
- ‚úÖ Added clear comments in workflow file explaining configuration
- ‚úÖ Created `PAGES_SETUP_REQUIRED.md` in repository root
- ‚è≥ **Still waiting for repository settings update**

## Why This Happened

The automatic GitHub Pages workflow (created by GitHub) fails when:
- Pages is enabled BUT
- The deployment source is set to "Deploy from a branch" instead of "GitHub Actions"

The workflow tries to deploy using GitHub Actions artifacts, but the API rejects it because Pages is expecting branch-based deployment.
