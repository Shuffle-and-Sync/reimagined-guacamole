## Production Deployment Readiness

The application is **PRODUCTION READY** from a security perspective.

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
See SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md for the complete pre-deployment checklist including:
- Environment configuration
- OAuth provider setup
- Security verification steps
- Monitoring setup
- Documentation updates

### Continuous Security
Automated security checks are now integrated into:
- ✅ Pull request reviews (dependency review)
- ✅ Main branch commits (full security audit)
- ✅ Weekly scheduled scans (Monday 9 AM UTC)
- ✅ Manual workflow dispatch available

## NPM Scripts Added

Run security checks anytime with:

```bash
# Run all security tests
npm run test:security

# Run comprehensive security audit
npm run security:audit

# Complete security check (audit + tests + type check)
npm run security:check
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Before Production Launch)
1. Generate new AUTH_SECRET: `openssl rand -base64 32`
2. Configure Google OAuth with production redirect URIs
3. Set ALLOWED_ORIGINS to production domain
4. Configure error tracking (Sentry)
5. Set up security event monitoring

### Short-term (First Month)
1. Monitor authentication logs for anomalies
2. Review rate limit violations
3. Set up automated alerts for security events
4. Document incident response procedures

### Ongoing
1. Run `npm audit` weekly
2. Review security logs daily
3. Rotate credentials quarterly
4. Update dependencies monthly
5. Conduct annual penetration testing
