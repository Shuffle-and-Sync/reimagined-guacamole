## Quick Decision Matrix

**Should we implement this feature now?**

| Question | Answer | Action |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Is it blocking users? | Yes | 🔴 Implement in Phase 1 |
| Do users request it often? | Yes | 🟡 Implement in Phase 2 |
| Is it in the PRD? | Yes | 🟢 Implement in Phase 3 |
| Is backend ready? | No | ⏸️ Defer until backend ready |
| Is it a nice-to-have? | Yes | 📋 Backlog for later |

**Resource Allocation:**
- 1 developer full-time: 6-8 weeks
- 2 developers full-time: 3-4 weeks
- Team of 3-4: 2-3 weeks
