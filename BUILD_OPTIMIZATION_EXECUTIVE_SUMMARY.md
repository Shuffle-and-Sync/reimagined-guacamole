## Implementation Quick Start

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 days, 30-40% impact)

```bash
# 1. Update .dockerignore (5 min)
cp .dockerignore.optimized .dockerignore

# 2. Enable CI/CD caching (15 min)
cp cloudbuild.optimized.yaml cloudbuild.yaml
cp cloudbuild-frontend.optimized.yaml cloudbuild-frontend.yaml

# 3. Optimize nginx config (10 min)
cp deployment/nginx.conf.optimized.template deployment/nginx.conf.template

# 4. Deploy and verify
gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.optimized.yaml
```

**Expected Results**:

- Build time reduced by 30-40%
- Smaller build context
- Better compression
- Same functionality

### Phase 2: Docker Optimization (2-3 days, 40-45% impact)

```bash
# Test optimized Dockerfile locally
docker build -f Dockerfile.optimized -t backend:optimized .

# Verify size reduction
docker images | grep backend

# Deploy to staging
gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.optimized.yaml \
  --substitutions=_SERVICE_NAME=backend-staging

# After validation, deploy to production
gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.optimized.yaml
```

**Expected Results**:

- Backend image: 800MB ‚Üí 350-450MB
- Better security (non-root user)
- Faster deployments

### Phase 3: Bundle Optimization (2-3 days, 12-15% impact)

```bash
# Update Vite config
cp vite.config.optimized.ts vite.config.ts

# Build and verify
npm run build
npm run build:analyze

# Deploy
gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild-frontend.optimized.yaml
```

**Expected Results**:

- Bundle size: ~215KB ‚Üí ~175-190KB gzipped
- Better code splitting
- Faster page loads
