## Why Archive?

Files are archived when:
1. They address temporary or resolved issues
2. Their content has been consolidated into comprehensive guides
3. They contain outdated approaches that have been improved
4. They're specific to legacy configurations no longer in use

Archiving preserves the historical context and solutions while keeping the active documentation clean and focused.
