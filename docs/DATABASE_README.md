## The Simple Answer

**Q: Do we need both Prisma and Cloud SQL PostgreSQL?**

**A: No.** You need **ONE PostgreSQL database** (local or Cloud SQL). Both Drizzle and Prisma connect to the SAME database instance. Drizzle is used for all runtime queries, Prisma is only used for build-time compatibility.

## Key Takeaways

From all the documentation, here are the most important points:

### ✅ What You Need to Know

1. **One Database**: You need ONE PostgreSQL database instance (local or Cloud SQL)

2. **Drizzle is Primary**: All runtime database queries use Drizzle ORM
   ```typescript
   import { db } from '@shared/database-unified';
   ```

3. **Prisma is Build-Only**: Prisma schema exists for build compatibility
   ```typescript
   export const prisma = null; // Not used at runtime
   ```

4. **JWT Sessions**: Authentication uses stateless JWT (no database sessions)
   ```typescript
   session: { strategy: "jwt" }
   ```

5. **Current Setup is Optimal**: No changes needed, already optimized for Cloud Run

### ❌ Common Misconceptions

1. ❌ "We have two databases" → ✅ One database, two tools
2. ❌ "Prisma needs its own database" → ✅ Prisma connects to same PostgreSQL
3. ❌ "We need Cloud SQL for Prisma" → ✅ Cloud SQL is for PostgreSQL, used by both
4. ❌ "Removing Prisma saves money" → ✅ No cost savings (same database)

## Quick Reference

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Development
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/shufflesync_dev

# Production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@/db?host=/cloudsql/PROJECT:REGION:INSTANCE
```

One `DATABASE_URL` used by both Drizzle (runtime) and Prisma (build).

### Common Commands

```bash
# Schema changes (use Drizzle)
npm run db:push              # Development
drizzle-kit generate         # Generate migration

# Health check
npm run db:health            # Test connection

# Build (includes Prisma generation)
npm run build
```
