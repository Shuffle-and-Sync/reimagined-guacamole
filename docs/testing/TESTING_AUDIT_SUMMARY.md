## How to Use These Reports

### For Developers

1. Review **TESTING_AUDIT_PART1.md** for comprehensive analysis
2. Use **coverage-analysis.csv** to filter files by risk/category
3. Start with P0 critical files from the prioritized list
4. Follow test type recommendations for each file

### For Project Managers

1. Review executive summary in **TESTING_AUDIT_PART1.md**
2. Use effort estimates to plan sprints
3. Prioritize based on risk levels (P0 → P1 → P2 → P3)
4. Track progress with **scripts/coverage-analysis.ts** (run periodically)

### For CI/CD

1. Use **coverage-analysis.json** for automation
2. Set up coverage gates based on thresholds
3. Run `scripts/coverage-analysis.ts` in CI pipeline
4. Generate reports on each PR

### Regenerating Reports

As tests are added:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/coverage-analysis.ts
```

This will update all reports with current coverage status.
