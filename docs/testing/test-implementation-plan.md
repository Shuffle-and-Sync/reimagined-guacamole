## Appendix: Quick Reference

### Test Naming Convention

```typescript
describe("Feature Name", () => {
  describe("Specific Functionality", () => {
    test("should behavior when condition", () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```

### Test Structure (AAA Pattern)

```typescript
test('should create user with valid data', async () => {
  // Arrange
  const userData = { email: 'test@example.com', ... };

  // Act
  const result = await createUser(userData);

  // Assert
  expect(result).toBeDefined();
  expect(result.email).toBe('test@example.com');
});
```

### Common Test Patterns

- **Unit Tests**: Test single function/method in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test multiple components working together
- **E2E Tests**: Test complete user workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Validate response times and load handling
