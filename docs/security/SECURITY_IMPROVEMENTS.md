# Security Improvements Documentation

This document details the security vulnerabilities that were identified and resolved in the Shuffle & Sync application.

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive security audit was conducted to identify and remediate critical security vulnerabilities in the codebase. The audit addressed hardcoded credentials, weak token generation, SQL injection risks, and sensitive data logging. All identified vulnerabilities have been resolved with proper security implementations.

**LATEST UPDATE**: Additional security enhancements have been implemented to address console logging vulnerabilities, enhance SQL injection protection, improve error handling robustness, and fix missing rate limiting on critical endpoints.

## Security Vulnerabilities Identified and Fixed

### 1. Weak Token Generation (CRITICAL) ✅

**Issue:** Webhook verify tokens were generated using weak patterns that could be predicted or brute-forced.

**Location:** `server/services/youtube-api.ts`

**Vulnerable Code:**

```typescript
this.webhookVerifyToken =
  process.env.YOUTUBE_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN ||
  "secure_random_token_" + Date.now();
```

**Fix:** Replaced with cryptographically secure token generation:

```typescript
this.webhookVerifyToken =
  process.env.YOUTUBE_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN || generateSecureToken();
```

**Impact:** Prevents token prediction attacks and ensures webhook security.

### 2. Sensitive Data Logging (HIGH) ✅

**Issue:** Console.log statements could expose sensitive information in production logs.

**Locations:**

- `server/services/youtube-api.ts` (3 instances)
- `server/storage.ts` (1 instance)
- `server/admin/admin.routes.ts` (37+ instances) **[NEWLY FIXED]**
- `server/admin/admin.middleware.ts` (8 instances) **[NEWLY FIXED]**
- `server/utils/stream-key-security.ts` (1 instance) **[NEWLY FIXED]**

**Vulnerable Code Examples:**

```typescript
console.log(
  `YouTube API ${response.status === 429 ? "rate limited" : "server error"}, retrying after ${delay}ms...`,
);
console.log(
  `[JWT_REVOCATION] Token ${jti} persisted to database for user ${userId}`,
);
console.error("Error fetching users:", error); // [NEWLY FIXED]
console.error("Failed to decrypt stream key:", error); // [NEWLY FIXED]
```

**Fix:** Replaced with structured logging that sanitizes sensitive data:

```typescript
logger.warn(
  `YouTube API ${response.status === 429 ? "rate limited" : "server error"}, retrying after ${delay}ms`,
  {
    status: response.status,
    attempt,
    delay,
  },
);
logger.info(`JWT token revoked for user`, { userId, hasJti: !!jti });
logger.error("Error fetching users", error, {
  userId: getAuthUserId(req),
  operation: "fetch_users",
}); // [NEWLY FIXED]
```

**Impact:** Eliminates risk of sensitive data exposure in production logs with context-aware structured logging.

### 2a. Missing Rate Limiting on Token Revocation Endpoint (HIGH) ✅ **[CodeQL Alert Fixed]**

**Issue:** The `/revoke-all` token revocation endpoint was missing proper rate limiting, allowing potential denial-of-service attacks through expensive database operations.

**Location:** `server/routes/auth/tokens.ts:241`

**Alert:** CodeQL rule `js/missing-rate-limiting`

**Vulnerable Code:**

```typescript
// Revoke all refresh tokens for user
router.post(
  "/revoke-all",
  requireHybridAuth,
  authRateLimit,  // Generic auth rate limiter - insufficient for this sensitive operation
  async (req, res) => {
    try {
      // Expensive database operation
      await storage.revokeAllUserRefreshTokens(userId);
    }
  }
);
```

**Security Risk:**

- Denial-of-service attacks through numerous rapid requests
- Database performance degradation from expensive revocation operations
- Legitimate users could be forced to be logged out repeatedly
- Generic IP-based rate limiting allowed one attacker to affect all users

**Fix:** Created dedicated user-specific rate limiter:

```typescript
// In server/rate-limiting.ts
export const tokenRevocationLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 5, // Limit each user to 5 token revocation requests per windowMs
  message: {
    error: "Too many token revocation attempts",
    retryAfter: "15 minutes",
  },
  standardHeaders: true,
  legacyHeaders: false,

  // Key by user ID to prevent one user from affecting others
  keyGenerator: (req: Request) => {
    const userId = safeGetUserId(req);
    return userId || req.ip || "unknown";
  },

  // Custom handler for better logging and error response
  handler: (req: Request, res: Response) => {
    const userId = safeGetUserId(req);
    logger.warn("Token revocation rate limit exceeded", {
      userId,
      ip: req.ip,
      userAgent: req.get("user-agent"),
      url: req.originalUrl,
    });

    res.status(429).json({
      error: "Too many token revocation attempts",
      message:
        "You have made too many token revocation requests. Please try again in 15 minutes.",
      retryAfter: 15 * 60, // seconds
    });
  },
});

// Updated route in server/routes/auth/tokens.ts
router.post(
  "/revoke-all",
  requireHybridAuth,
  tokenRevocationLimiter, // Dedicated strict rate limiter
  async (req, res) => {
    // ... implementation
  },
);
```

**Impact:**

- Prevents denial-of-service attacks on token revocation endpoint
- User-specific rate limiting isolates users from each other's actions
- Enhanced logging for security monitoring and incident response
- Clear error messages with retry-after information for better UX
- CodeQL security alert resolved ✅

**Test Coverage:**

- 24 comprehensive test cases in `server/tests/auth/token-revocation-rate-limiting.test.ts`
- Tests verify configuration, integration, security best practices, and validation
- All existing auth tests continue to pass

### 3. SQL Injection Risk (HIGH) ✅ **[ENHANCED]**

**Issue:** Input sanitization was insufficient and lacked detection of injection patterns.

**Location:** `server/utils/database.utils.ts`

**Original Enhancement:** Added comprehensive SQL injection pattern detection:

```typescript
const suspiciousPatterns = [
  /(\b(union|select|insert|update|delete|drop|alter|create|exec|execute|sp_|xp_)\b)/gi,
  /(--|\/*|\*/|;|'|"|`)/g,
  /(\bor\b|\band\b).*[=<>]/gi,
  /(\bwhere\b|\bhaving\b).*[=<>]/gi
];
```

**New Enhancement:** Extended with 9 additional security pattern categories:

```typescript
const suspiciousPatterns = [
  // SQL keywords
  /(\b(union|select|insert|update|delete|drop|alter|create|exec|execute|sp_|xp_)\b)/gi,
  // SQL comments and special chars
  /(--|\/*|\*/|;|'|"|`)/g,
  // Boolean injections
  /(\bor\b|\band\b).*[=<>]/gi,
  /(\bwhere\b|\bhaving\b).*[=<>]/gi,
  // Additional injection patterns **[NEW]**
  /(\binto\b|\bfrom\b|\bjoin\b|\bunion\b).*(\bselect\b|\binsert\b|\bupdate\b|\bdelete\b)/gi,
  // Hex injection attempts **[NEW]**
  /0x[0-9a-f]/gi,
  // Database functions **[NEW]**
  /(\bcast\b|\bconvert\b|\bchar\b|\bchr\b|\bascii\b|\bsubstring\b|\bmid\b|\bleft\b|\bright\b)/gi,
  // Information schema queries **[NEW]**
  /information_schema/gi,
  // System tables **[NEW]**
  /(\bsys\b|\bmysql\b|\bpostgres\b|\bpg_\b)/gi
];
```

**Enhanced XSS Protection:**

```typescript
// Added additional XSS vector protection
.replace(/vbscript:/gi, '') // Remove vbscript: protocol **[NEW]**
.replace(/onload\s*=/gi, '') // Remove onload handlers **[NEW]**
.replace(/onerror\s*=/gi, '') // Remove onerror handlers **[NEW]**
```

**Impact:** Provides comprehensive protection against advanced SQL injection and XSS attacks with enhanced logging.

### 4. Credential Management (MEDIUM) ✅

**Issue:** No systematic approach to credential validation and leak detection.

**Solution:** Created comprehensive security utilities in `server/utils/security.utils.ts`:

- **Environment Variable Validation:** Ensures required credentials are present and secure
- **Credential Leak Detection:** Patterns to detect exposed API keys, tokens, and secrets
- **Token Strength Validation:** Validates cryptographic strength of tokens and secrets
- **Security Auditing:** Automated security configuration validation

**Implementation Status:** ✅ Complete with comprehensive test coverage

### 5. TypeScript Compilation Errors (MEDIUM) ✅ **[NEWLY FIXED]**

**Issue:** TypeScript compilation errors in security-related functions.

**Locations Fixed:**

- `server/utils/security.utils.ts` line 165: Error type assertion
- `server/utils/database.utils.ts`: Undefined `lastError` variable
- `server/admin/admin.middleware.ts`: Parameter context issues

**Fix Examples:**

```typescript
// Before
} catch (error) {
  issues.push(`Environment validation failed: ${error.message}`);
}

// After
} catch (error) {
  issues.push(`Environment validation failed: ${(error as Error).message}`);
}
```

**Impact:** Ensures code compiles without errors and improves runtime stability.
