## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Keep PostgreSQL (Not NoSQL)

**Rationale**:

- ✅ JSONB provides schema flexibility comparable to NoSQL
- ✅ ACID transactions critical for game state integrity
- ✅ Relational model perfect for game/card/user relationships
- ✅ No migration cost, team already familiar
- ✅ Full-text search built-in
- ❌ NoSQL migration would be costly and risky

**Result**: PostgreSQL + JSONB gives us 90% of NoSQL flexibility with 100% of ACID guarantees

### 2. Backward Compatibility First

**Approach**:

- Keep existing `/api/cards/*` endpoints working
- Internal redirect to `mtg-official` game
- Add deprecation warnings
- Gradual migration path for clients

**Result**: Zero downtime, zero breaking changes for existing users

### 3. Adapter Pattern for Card Services

**Design**:

```typescript
interface ICardAdapter {
  searchCards(query: string): Promise<Card[]>;
  getCardById(id: string): Promise<Card>;
}

// Implementations:
-ScryfallAdapter(MTG) -
  PokemonTCGAdapter(Pokemon) -
  CustomGameAdapter(User - defined);
```

**Result**: Easy to add new game integrations, clean separation of concerns

---

## Security Considerations

### Implemented Safeguards

1. **Rate Limiting**
   - 5 games per user per day
   - 50 card submissions per user per day
   - Per-endpoint API rate limits

2. **Input Validation**
   - Zod schemas on all inputs
   - Content sanitization
   - Image size limits (5MB max)

3. **Moderation Workflow**
   - Pending → Peer Review → Moderator Approval
   - Auto-approval for trusted users
   - Spam detection algorithms

4. **Access Control**
   - Game creators can edit their games
   - Moderators can review submissions
   - Admins can approve games
   - Public can view published content

---

## Performance Optimization

### Database Indexes

```sql
✅ Full-text search on card names
✅ Game lookup indexes (published, official)
✅ Card search indexes (game_id, name, external_id)
✅ Analytics composite indexes (game_id, date)
✅ Unique constraints to prevent duplicates
```

### Caching Strategy

```typescript
Game definitions: 24h TTL (rarely change)
Card data: 7d TTL (update occasionally)
Search results: 5m TTL (frequently change)
User sessions: 1h TTL
```

### Query Optimization

```typescript
✅ Pagination on all list endpoints
✅ Selective field loading (don't fetch JSONB unless needed)
✅ Connection pooling for serverless
✅ Materialized views for analytics (planned)
```
