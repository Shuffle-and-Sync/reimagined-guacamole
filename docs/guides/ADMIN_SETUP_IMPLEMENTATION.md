# Admin Account Setup - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the master/administrator account setup and configuration system for Shuffle & Sync.

## Issue Addressed

**Issue**: Ensure master/administrator account is set up and properly configured

The system needed:

- A way to create and manage the initial admin account
- Environment-based configuration for admin credentials
- Verification tools to audit admin account status
- Comprehensive documentation for operational needs
- Security best practices for admin access

## Implementation Details

### 1. Environment Configuration

**New Environment Variables:**

- `MASTER_ADMIN_EMAIL` - Email address of the primary system administrator (required)
- `MASTER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Password for credentials authentication (optional, OAuth recommended)

**Files Updated:**

- `.env.example` - Added admin configuration section
- `.env.production.template` - Added admin configuration with production checklist

### 2. Admin Initialization Script

**File Created:** `scripts/init-admin.ts`

**Features:**

- Automated admin account creation with secure defaults
- Email validation and format checking
- Password hashing using Argon2id
- Super admin role assignment
- Email pre-verification
- Support for both OAuth and credentials authentication
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Idempotent operation (safe to run multiple times)

**Usage:**

```bash
# Initialize admin account
npm run admin:init

# Verify admin account setup
npm run admin:verify
```

### 3. Package Scripts

**Added to package.json:**

- `admin:init` - Initialize or update admin account
- `admin:verify` - Verify admin account configuration

### 4. API Endpoints

#### GET /api/admin/system/status

Returns comprehensive admin configuration status:

- Admin email configuration
- User existence and ID
- Super admin role assignment
- Email verification status
- Authentication methods available
- MFA status
- Last login information

**Access:** Requires `super_admin` permission

#### POST /api/admin/system/verify-admin

Performs comprehensive verification checks:

## Security Features

### Authentication Methods

**OAuth (Google) - Recommended:**

- No password to leak or crack
- Leverages Google's security infrastructure
- Automatic MFA via Google Account
- Easy account recovery
- Full audit trail

**Credentials (Password) - Optional:**

- 12+ character minimum password
- Argon2id hashing
- Password strength validation
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- MFA support

### Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Email Pre-verification** - Admin accounts are created with verified email status
2. **Strong Password Requirements** - Minimum 12 characters if using credentials
3. **Role-Based Access Control** - Super admin role with all permissions
4. **Audit Logging** - All admin actions are logged
5. **Secure Defaults** - OAuth-only authentication recommended
6. **Environment-Based Config** - Credentials stored in environment variables
7. **MFA Recommendations** - Security checks recommend enabling MFA

### Admin Role Hierarchy

1. **Super Admin** (`super_admin`) - Full system access, all permissions
2. **Admin** (`admin`) - Most administrative functions, user management, content moderation
3. **Trust & Safety** (`trust_safety`) - User safety, ban management, evasion tracking
4. **Moderator** (`moderator`) - Content moderation, queue management
5. **Community Manager** (`community_manager`) - CMS, analytics, community content

## Deployment Integration

### Pre-Deployment Steps

1. Set `MASTER_ADMIN_EMAIL` in environment or Secret Manager
2. Optionally set `MASTER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (or use OAuth-only)
3. Run database migrations
4. Run `npm run admin:init`
5. Verify with `npm run admin:verify`

### Production Deployment

The deployment process now includes admin initialization:

```bash
# In deployment script
npm run admin:init
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "✓ Admin account initialized"
else
  echo "✗ Admin account initialization failed"
  exit 1
fi
```

> **Note**: When running deployment scripts directly on Windows, use: `bash scripts/deploy-production.sh`

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] `MASTER_ADMIN_EMAIL` configured
- [ ] Admin user created in database
- [ ] Super admin role assigned
- [ ] Email verified
- [ ] Authentication method configured (OAuth or password)
- [ ] MFA enabled (recommended)
- [ ] Admin credentials stored in password manager
- [ ] First login successful

## Operational Procedures

### Initial Setup (Development)

```bash
# 1. Set admin email in .env.local
echo "MASTER_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@localhost" >> .env.local

# 2. Initialize admin account
npm run admin:init

# 3. Verify setup
npm run admin:verify

# 4. Sign in with admin credentials
# - Use Google OAuth, or
# - Use email/password if MASTER_ADMIN_PASSWORD is set
```

### Initial Setup (Production)

```bash
# 1. Configure in Secret Manager
gcloud secrets create MASTER_ADMIN_EMAIL --data-file=- <<< "admin@yourdomain.com"

# 2. Deploy application
bash scripts/deploy-production.sh

# 3. Initialize admin (runs automatically in deployment)
# Or manually:
npm run admin:init

# 4. Verify
npm run admin:verify

# 5. Sign in and enable MFA
```

### Verification via API

```bash
# Check system status
curl -X GET https://your-domain.com/api/admin/system/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Run verification
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/admin/system/verify-admin \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **Admin email not configured**
   - Solution: Set `MASTER_ADMIN_EMAIL` environment variable

2. **Password too short**
   - Solution: Use 12+ character password or use OAuth-only

3. **Role not assigned**
   - Solution: Re-run `npm run admin:init`

4. **Cannot sign in**
   - Check authentication method (OAuth vs credentials)
   - Verify account is not locked
   - Check email verification status

## Audit Trail

All admin account operations are logged:

```sql
-- View admin initialization logs
SELECT * FROM admin_audit_log
WHERE action LIKE '%role%'
  AND category = 'role_assignment'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## Next Steps

### Recommended Actions

1. **Enable MFA** - After first login, enable MFA for admin account
2. **Review Permissions** - Audit admin role permissions regularly
3. **Monitor Access** - Set up alerts for admin login attempts
4. **Rotate Credentials** - Change admin password every 90 days
5. **Backup Admin** - Consider creating a backup admin account
6. **Documentation** - Keep admin contact information updated

### Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future consideration:

- [ ] Multi-admin support with different permission levels
- [ ] Admin session monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Automated admin credential rotation
- [ ] Admin access IP whitelisting
- [ ] Two-person rule for critical operations
- [ ] Admin activity notifications
- [ ] Emergency access procedures
