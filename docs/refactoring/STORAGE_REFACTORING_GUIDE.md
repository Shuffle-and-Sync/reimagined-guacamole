# Storage Refactoring Guide

## Overview

This guide provides a systematic approach to refactoring the monolithic `server/storage.ts` (8,771 lines, 267 methods) into domain-specific repositories using the repository pattern.

## Current Status

### âœ… Phase 1: Infrastructure Complete

The foundation for the repository pattern has been established:

- **BaseRepository**: Abstract class providing common CRUD operations
- **RepositoryFactory**: Dependency injection container with singleton pattern
- **UserRepository**: First domain repository (partially migrated)
- **Test Infrastructure**: 94 tests passing, 100% coverage of base functionality

See full guide content for detailed implementation instructions.
