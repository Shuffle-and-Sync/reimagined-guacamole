- client/src/pages/tournaments.tsx
- client/src/pages/home.tsx

**Security Impact**: ✅ None  
**Analysis**:

- Only wrapped existing functions with useCallback
- No changes to function logic or data handling
- Dependency arrays correctly specified
- No new attack vectors introduced

#### 2. Documentation Added

**Files Created**:

- docs/performance/USECALLBACK_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md
- PERFORMANCE_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md

**Security Impact**: ✅ None  
**Analysis**:

- Documentation only
- No executable code
- No sensitive information exposed

#### 3. Build Configuration

**Status**: No changes to build configuration

**Security Impact**: ✅ None  
**Analysis**:

- Existing vite.config.ts verified
- Source maps disabled in production ✅
- Minification enabled ✅
- No insecure dependencies introduced ✅

## Security Best Practices Maintained

### Code Quality

- ✅ TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ✅ ESLint security rules active
- ✅ No unsafe type assertions
- ✅ Proper error handling maintained

### Input Validation

- ✅ Zod schemas for validation (unchanged)
- ✅ Drizzle ORM parameterized queries (unchanged)
- ✅ No direct SQL execution
- ✅ CSRF protection intact

### Authentication & Authorization

- ✅ Auth.js v5 integration intact
- ✅ Session security maintained
- ✅ Protected routes unchanged
- ✅ No bypass vulnerabilities

### Data Protection

- ✅ No sensitive data exposed in logs
- ✅ Environment variables properly used
- ✅ Database credentials protected
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets

---

## Vulnerability Assessment

### Potential Risk Areas Reviewed

#### Re-rendering & Memory

**Risk**: Could excessive re-renders cause DoS?  
**Assessment**: ✅ Low Risk  
**Mitigation**: useCallback reduces unnecessary re-renders, improving performance

#### Callback Dependencies

**Risk**: Could incorrect dependencies cause security bugs?  
**Assessment**: ✅ Mitigated  
**Mitigation**: All dependency arrays reviewed and tested

#### Code Splitting

**Risk**: Could lazy loading expose routes?  
**Assessment**: ✅ No Risk  
**Mitigation**: Auth checks happen before component load

#### Bundle Analysis

**Risk**: Could bundle reveal sensitive information?  
**Assessment**: ✅ No Risk  
**Mitigation**: Source maps disabled in production
