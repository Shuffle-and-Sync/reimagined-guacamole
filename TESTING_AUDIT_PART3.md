---

## Key Testing Patterns Used

### 1. Test Data Factories

```typescript
const createMockTournament = (overrides = {}) => ({
  id: "tournament-123",
  name: "Test Tournament",
  ...overrides,
});
```

### 2. Mock Dependency Injection

```typescript
jest.mock("../../storage", () => ({
  storage: {
    getTournament: jest.fn(),
    createTournament: jest.fn(),
    // ... other mocked methods
  },
}));
```

### 3. Comprehensive Test Scenarios

- Happy path (successful operations)
- Error cases (validation failures, permissions)
- Edge cases (empty data, boundary values)
- Concurrent operations
- Performance benchmarks

### 4. Descriptive Test Organization

```typescript
describe("Feature Name - Test Type", () => {
  describe("Specific Functionality", () => {
    test("should do something specific", () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```
