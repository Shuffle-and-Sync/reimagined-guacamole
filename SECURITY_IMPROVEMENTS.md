# Security Improvements Documentation

This document details the security vulnerabilities that were identified and resolved in the Shuffle & Sync application.

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive security audit was conducted to identify and remediate critical security vulnerabilities in the codebase. The audit addressed hardcoded credentials, weak token generation, SQL injection risks, and sensitive data logging. All identified vulnerabilities have been resolved with proper security implementations.

## Security Vulnerabilities Identified and Fixed

### 1. Weak Token Generation (CRITICAL)

**Issue:** Webhook verify tokens were generated using weak patterns that could be predicted or brute-forced.

**Location:** `server/services/youtube-api.ts`

**Vulnerable Code:** 
```typescript
this.webhookVerifyToken = process.env.YOUTUBE_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN || 'secure_random_token_' + Date.now();
```

**Fix:** Replaced with cryptographically secure token generation:
```typescript
this.webhookVerifyToken = process.env.YOUTUBE_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN || generateSecureToken();
```

**Impact:** Prevents token prediction attacks and ensures webhook security.

### 2. Sensitive Data Logging (HIGH)

**Issue:** Console.log statements could expose sensitive information in production logs.

**Locations:** 
- `server/services/youtube-api.ts` (3 instances)
- `server/storage.ts` (1 instance)

**Vulnerable Code Examples:**
```typescript
console.log(`YouTube API ${response.status === 429 ? 'rate limited' : 'server error'}, retrying after ${delay}ms...`);
console.log(`[JWT_REVOCATION] Token ${jti} persisted to database for user ${userId}`);
```

**Fix:** Replaced with structured logging that sanitizes sensitive data:
```typescript
logger.warn(`YouTube API ${response.status === 429 ? 'rate limited' : 'server error'}, retrying after ${delay}ms`, { 
  status: response.status, 
  attempt, 
  delay 
});
logger.info(`JWT token revoked for user`, { userId, hasJti: !!jti });
```

**Impact:** Prevents credential and sensitive data exposure in logs.

### 3. SQL Injection Risk (HIGH)

**Issue:** Input sanitization was insufficient and lacked detection of injection patterns.

**Location:** `server/utils/database.utils.ts`

**Enhancement:** Added comprehensive SQL injection pattern detection:
```typescript
const suspiciousPatterns = [
  /(\b(union|select|insert|update|delete|drop|alter|create|exec|execute|sp_|xp_)\b)/gi,
  /(--|\/\*|\*\/|;|'|"|`)/g,
  /(\bor\b|\band\b).*[=<>]/gi,
  /(\bwhere\b|\bhaving\b).*[=<>]/gi
];
```

**Impact:** Provides early detection and logging of potential SQL injection attempts.

### 4. Credential Management (MEDIUM)

**Issue:** No systematic approach to credential validation and leak detection.

**Solution:** Created comprehensive security utilities in `server/utils/security.utils.ts`:

- **Environment Variable Validation:** Ensures required credentials are present and secure
- **Credential Leak Detection:** Patterns to detect exposed API keys, tokens, and secrets
- **Token Strength Validation:** Validates cryptographic strength of tokens and secrets
- **Security Auditing:** Automated security configuration validation

## New Security Features Implemented

### 1. Secure Token Generation (`generateSecureToken`)
```typescript
export function generateSecureToken(length: number = 32): string {
  return crypto.randomBytes(length).toString('hex');
}
```

### 2. Credential Leak Detection (`detectCredentialLeak`)
Detects patterns for:
- GitHub tokens (ghp_, gho_, ghu_, ghs_)
- Google API keys (AIza...)
- Slack tokens (xox...)
- Generic API keys (sk_...)
- JWT tokens
- GitLab tokens (glpat-)

### 3. Input Sanitization Enhancement
- XSS protection (removes `<script>`, `javascript:`, `data:` protocols)
- SQL injection pattern detection and logging
- Control character removal
- Nested object and array sanitization

### 4. Security Configuration Audit (`auditSecurityConfiguration`)
Automated checks for:
- Missing required environment variables
- Weak credential patterns in production
- AUTH_SECRET complexity requirements
- Development credentials in production environment

## Security Middleware and Headers

The application already includes comprehensive security middleware:

### Security Headers
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- Content Security Policy (environment-specific)
- HSTS in production

### Input Validation
- Zod schema validation for all inputs
- Parameter validation middleware
- Request body and query sanitization
- UUID validation for identifiers

## Testing Coverage

Comprehensive test suites were created to validate security implementations:

### Security Utilities Tests (`server/tests/security/security.utils.test.ts`)
- Token generation and validation
- Credential leak detection
- JWT secret strength validation
- Security configuration auditing

### Input Sanitization Tests (`server/tests/security/input-sanitization.test.ts`)
- SQL injection pattern detection
- XSS protection validation
- Nested object sanitization
- Control character removal

## Production Deployment Considerations

### Environment Variables
Ensure the following environment variables are properly configured in production:

**Required:**
- `AUTH_SECRET` (minimum 32 characters, high complexity)
- `DATABASE_URL` (secure connection string)
- `AUTH_URL` (production domain)

**Optional but Recommended:**
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` (for OAuth)
- `YOUTUBE_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` (cryptographically secure)
- `TWITCH_CLIENT_ID` and `TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET` (for streaming integration)

### Security Audit on Startup
The application now performs a security audit on startup and will:
- Log warnings for security issues in development
- Exit with error code 1 in production if critical security issues are found

### Monitoring and Alerting
- All security-related events are logged with structured data
- Potential SQL injection attempts are logged for monitoring
- Credential leak attempts are detected and sanitized

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Defense in Depth:** Multiple layers of security validation
2. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Minimal data exposure in logs
3. **Secure by Default:** Strong defaults for token generation and validation
4. **Fail Secure:** Application exits on critical security failures in production
5. **Comprehensive Logging:** All security events are properly logged for audit

## Remaining Security Considerations

While all identified vulnerabilities have been addressed, consider these additional security measures:

1. **Rate Limiting:** Already implemented but should be monitored and tuned
2. **Session Security:** Already using secure session configuration
3. **HTTPS Enforcement:** Ensure HTTPS is enforced in production
4. **Dependency Scanning:** Regular updates and vulnerability scanning of dependencies
5. **Content Security Policy:** Already implemented but should be regularly reviewed
