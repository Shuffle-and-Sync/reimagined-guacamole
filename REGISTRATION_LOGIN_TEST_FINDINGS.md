## Key Findings

### ✅ What Works Correctly

#### 1. Custom Credentials Registration
- **Password Validation**: Enforces strong passwords (12+ chars, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks for existing email and username
- **Email Verification**: Sends verification email with 24-hour token
- **Data Normalization**: Converts email and username to lowercase, trims whitespace
- **Response Format**: Returns clear success message and user data

#### 2. Custom Credentials Login
- **Email Verification Check**: Blocks login until email is verified
- **Password Verification**: Uses Argon2id for secure password hashing
- **Security Features**:
  - Rate limiting: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
  - Account lockout: After 5 failed attempts, 30-minute lockout
  - Failed attempt tracking: Increments on wrong password, resets on success
- **MFA Support**: Prompts for TOTP code when enabled
- **Session Creation**: JWT sessions with 30-day expiration

#### 3. Google OAuth Authentication
- **Auto-Registration**: Creates user automatically on first login
- **Email Pre-Verification**: OAuth users don't need email verification
- **Profile Updates**: Updates name and profile picture on subsequent logins
- **No Password**: OAuth users have `passwordHash: null`
- **Immediate Access**: No additional steps after OAuth consent

#### 4. Email Verification
- **Token Generation**: Creates JWT token for verification
- **24-Hour Expiry**: Tokens expire after 24 hours
- **Resend Capability**: Users can request new verification email
- **Status Update**: Sets `isEmailVerified: true` on verification

#### 5. Error Handling
- **Clear Messages**: User-friendly error messages for all scenarios
- **Invalid Email**: "Invalid email or password"
- **Unverified Email**: "Please verify your email address before signing in. Check your inbox for the verification link."
- **OAuth User Trying Credentials**: "This account uses OAuth authentication. Please sign in with Google or Twitch."
- **Account Locked**: "Account is temporarily locked. Try again in X minutes."
- **Rate Limited**: "Too many failed attempts. Try again in X seconds."
- **MFA Required**: "MFA_REQUIRED: Please complete multi-factor authentication. Check your authenticator app for the verification code."

#### 6. Session Management
- **JWT Strategy**: Uses JWT tokens instead of database sessions
- **30-Day Expiration**: Sessions last 30 days
- **User ID Included**: JWT payload contains user ID and email
- **Session Validation**: Proper validation on protected routes

## Recommended User Flows

### Flow 1: New User with Email/Password
```
1. User fills registration form → POST /api/auth/register
2. System validates password strength
3. System checks email/username uniqueness
4. System creates user (isEmailVerified: false)
5. System sends verification email
6. User checks email and clicks verification link → GET /api/auth/verify-email
7. System sets isEmailVerified: true
8. User navigates to sign-in page
9. User enters email and password → POST /api/auth/signin/credentials
10. System verifies email is confirmed
11. System verifies password
12. System creates JWT session
13. User redirected to /home
```

### Flow 2: New User with Google OAuth
```
1. User clicks "Continue with Google" → GET /api/auth/signin/google
2. User redirected to Google OAuth consent
3. User authorizes application
4. Google redirects to callback → /api/auth/callback/google
5. System creates new user (isEmailVerified: true, passwordHash: null)
6. System creates JWT session
7. User redirected to /home
```

### Flow 3: Returning Credentials User
```
1. User enters email and password → POST /api/auth/signin/credentials
2. System verifies email is confirmed
3. System verifies password
4. If MFA enabled, prompt for code
5. System creates JWT session
6. User redirected to /home
```

### Flow 4: Returning OAuth User
```
1. User clicks "Continue with Google" → GET /api/auth/signin/google
2. User redirected to Google OAuth consent
3. User authorizes application
4. Google redirects to callback → /api/auth/callback/google
5. System updates existing user profile
6. System creates JWT session
7. User redirected to /home
```

## Known Behaviors (Not Issues)

### Expected Constraints
1. **Email Verification Required**: Credentials users MUST verify email before login
   - This is intentional for security
   - OAuth users skip this step (trusted provider)

2. **OAuth Users Cannot Use Credentials Login**: Users who signed up with Google cannot login with password
   - This is intentional (no password set)
   - Error message guides users to use OAuth

3. **Account Lockout Cannot Be Bypassed**: 30-minute lockout after 5 failed attempts
   - This is intentional for security
   - Users must wait or use password reset

4. **MFA Blocks Standard Login**: MFA-enabled users must provide TOTP code
   - This is intentional for security
   - No bypass available
